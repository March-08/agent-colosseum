  purpose: >
    Minimal declarative game specs for generating Python game class instances.
    Separation of concerns: identity + parameters + private_state_draw + state + phases/actions + resolution + timeout.
  conventions:
    outcome_rule: [engine, agreement, mediator]
    rng_seed: match_id
    payoffs: >
      Unless otherwise specified, payoffs are utilities (can be negative).
      If a role is referenced (buyer/seller), roles are assigned by agent order unless parameters specify role_map.


game_id: first-price-auction
  name: "First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction"
  min_agents: 2
  outcome_rule: engine
  description: >
    Each agent draws a private valuation and submits one sealed bid. Highest bid wins and pays their own bid
    (ties broken randomly). Winner utility = valuation - bid; others get 0. Resolves on all bids or timeout.
parameters: {max_rounds: 10, valuation_range: [0, 100], valuations: null}
private_state_draw:
  valuations: {source: random_or_fixed, random: {dist: uniform, low: 0, high: 100, seed: match_id}}
initial_state: {bids: {}, action_history: [], resolved: false}
phases:
  - {name: auction, turn_order: round_robin, max_rounds: 10, allowed_actions: [submit_bid, pass, message]}
actions:
  submit_bid:
    payload_schema: {bid: {type: number, min: 0}}
    advances_turn: true
    preconditions: ["agent_id not in state.bids"]
    effects: ["state.bids[agent_id] = bid", "append action_history"]
  pass: {payload_schema: {}, advances_turn: true, effects: ["append action_history"]}
  message: {payload_schema: {message: {type: string}}, advances_turn: false, effects: ["append action_history"]}
resolution:
  trigger: "len(state.bids) == num_agents"
  outcome:
    winner: "argmax(state.bids) with tiebreak random(seed=match_id+'_tiebreak')"
    price: "state.bids[winner]"
    payoffs:
      winner: "private.valuations[winner] - price"
