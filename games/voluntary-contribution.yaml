  purpose: >
    Minimal declarative game specs for generating Python game class instances.
    Separation of concerns: identity + parameters + private_state_draw + state + phases/actions + resolution + timeout.
  conventions:
    outcome_rule: [engine, agreement, mediator]
    rng_seed: match_id
    payoffs: >
      Unless otherwise specified, payoffs are utilities (can be negative).
      If a role is referenced (buyer/seller), roles are assigned by agent order unless parameters specify role_map.

  description: >
    Each agent chooses a contribution to a public good. Total contribution determines public good level.
    Each agent gets benefit based on total contribution and pays own contribution. Resolves after all contribute.
parameters:
  max_rounds: 10
  endowment: 10
  multiplier: 0.5     # per-unit marginal benefit to each agent from total contributions

  contribute:
    payload_schema: {amount: {type: number, min: 0}}
    advances_turn: true
    preconditions: ["agent_id not in state.contribs", "amount <= parameters.endowment"]

  pass: {payload_schema: {}, advances_turn: true, effects: ["append action_history"]}
  message: {payload_schema: {message: {type: string}}, advances_turn: false, effects: ["append action_history"]}
resolution:
