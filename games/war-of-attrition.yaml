notes:
  purpose: >
    Minimal declarative game specs for generating Python game class instances.
    Separation of concerns: identity + parameters + private_state_draw + state + phases/actions + resolution + timeout.
  conventions:
    outcome_rule: [engine, agreement, mediator]
    rng_seed: match_id
    payoffs: >
      Unless otherwise specified, payoffs are utilities (can be negative).
      If a role is referenced (buyer/seller), roles are assigned by agent order unless parameters specify role_map.


game_id: war-of-attrition
  name: "War of Attrition (Quit-Time Competition)"
  min_agents: 2
  outcome_rule: engine
  description: >
    Each agent chooses a quit time t (or equivalently a bid). Highest t wins the prize but both pay cost proportional
    to the minimum quit time. Winner utility = prize - cost*min_t; loser utility = -cost*min_t. Resolves after all submit.
parameters:
  max_rounds: 10
  prize: 10
  cost_rate: 1
  time_range: [0, 10]

initial_state: {times: {}, action_history: [], resolved: false}
phases:
  - {name: choose_time, turn_order: round_robin, max_rounds: 10, allowed_actions: [submit_time, pass, message]}
actions:
  submit_time:
    payload_schema: {t: {type: number, min: 0}}
    advances_turn: true
    preconditions: ["agent_id not in state.times"]

  pass: {payload_schema: {}, advances_turn: true, effects: ["append action_history"]}
  message: {payload_schema: {message: {type: string}}, advances_turn: false, effects: ["append action_history"]}
resolution:
  trigger: "len(state.times) == num_agents"
  outcome:
    winner: "argmax(state.times) with tiebreak random(seed=match_id+'_tiebreak')"
    min_t: "min(state.times.values())"
