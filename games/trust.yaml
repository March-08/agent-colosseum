  purpose: >
    Minimal declarative game specs for generating Python game class instances.
    Separation of concerns: identity + parameters + private_state_draw + state + phases/actions + resolution + timeout.
  conventions:
    outcome_rule: [engine, agreement, mediator]
    rng_seed: match_id
    payoffs: >
      Unless otherwise specified, payoffs are utilities (can be negative).
      If a role is referenced (buyer/seller), roles are assigned by agent order unless parameters specify role_map.

  name: "Trust (Investment then Return)"
  min_agents: 2
  outcome_rule: engine
  description: >
    Trustor sends an amount x from an endowment E to trustee. The amount is multiplied by m. Trustee chooses how much to return r.
    Payoffs: trustor = (E - x) + r; trustee = (m*x - r). Resolves after send and return or timeout.
parameters:
  max_rounds: 8
  endowment: 10
  multiplier: 3
  role_map: null  # {trustor, trustee}
private_state_draw: {}
initial_state: {sent: null, returned: null, action_history: [], resolved: false}
phases:
  - {name: send, turn_order: role_based, roles: [trustor], max_rounds: 3, allowed_actions: [send, pass, message]}
  - {name: return, turn_order: role_based, roles: [trustee], max_rounds: 3, allowed_actions: [return, pass, message]}
actions:
  send:
    payload_schema: {amount: {type: number, min: 0}}
    advances_turn: true
    preconditions: ["amount <= parameters.endowment"]

resolution:
  trigger: "state.resolved == true"
  outcome:
    payoffs:
